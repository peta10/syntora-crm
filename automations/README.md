## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive names for your workflow files:
- `{module}-{action}-{description}.json`
- Examples:
  - `todos-create-from-email.json`
  - `projects-deadline-reminder.json`
  - `contacts-sync-to-crm.json`
  - `analytics-daily-report.json`

## Workflow Development Best Practices

1. **Always validate workflows** before deployment using n8n MCP tools
2. **Use descriptive names** for nodes and workflows
3. **Add error handling** for critical workflows
4. **Document complex expressions** with comments
5. **Test thoroughly** before production deployment

## Getting Started

1. Create your workflow in n8n or use n8n MCP tools
2. Export/save as `.json` file in the appropriate folder
3. Use descriptive naming conventions
4. Add documentation in comments within the workflow
5. Test and validate before deployment
